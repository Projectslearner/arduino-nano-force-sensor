### Force Sensor

#### Project Overview

The Force Sensor project utilizes an Arduino Nano to measure and monitor the output of a force sensor. This project is valuable in applications where the measurement of physical force or pressure is required, such as in robotics, biomechanics, or industrial automation.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **Force Sensor**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Force Sensor to Arduino Nano:**
   - Connect the output pin of the force sensor to an analog input pin (e.g., A0) on the Arduino Nano.
   - Ensure the power and ground connections of the force sensor are appropriately connected to the Arduino Nano.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the force sensor to the Arduino Nano according to the circuit setup.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Connect the Arduino Nano to your computer using a USB cable.
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Select the appropriate board (Arduino Nano) and port from the Tools menu.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

3. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, open the serial monitor.
   - Observe the force sensor values displayed on the serial monitor as force is applied to the sensor.

#### Applications

- **Robotics:** Measure force exerted by robotic arms, grippers, or actuators.
- **Biomechanics:** Monitor pressure distribution in medical devices or biomechanical research.
- **Industrial Automation:** Control and monitor pressure-sensitive processes in manufacturing environments.

#### Notes

- Ensure correct wiring and connection between the force sensor and the Arduino Nano.
- Calibrate the sensor if necessary to adjust for different force ranges or sensitivities.
- Experiment with different delay values in the code to optimize the monitoring frequency or responsiveness.
